# Mergington High School Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for
our school community, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to
make participation in the Extra-Curricular Activities project a
respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the students and the school community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of inappropriate language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a school setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that
are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or the school. Examples of
representing the project include using an official project email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the IT Club faculty advisor. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the school administration.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
version 1.4, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Communicate easier with issue templates
Now let's create templates so other teachers can report bugs or request features in a standardized way.

Tip

You might consider trying the public preview for issue forms, which provide a friendlier user experience when creating issues.

In the top navigation, select the Settings tab.

Find the Features section and verify Issues is enabled.


Click the Set up templates button to enter the issue templates editor.

(Optional) Let's keep it simple for our students and fellow teachers. Remove the sections about Desktop and Smartphone details.

Repeat the above steps for the "Feature request" template.

With our templates prepared, let's commit them. In the top right, click the Propose changes button. Enter a description and set the branch to add-issue-templates, then click Commit changes. You can ignore the automatically created pull request.

Tip

Did you notice that you are working in parallel on 2 branches now? That's exactly what working with multiple collaborators is like.
